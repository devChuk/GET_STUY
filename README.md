Everyone is making a spoof of 2048 these days, so I decided to have some fun with Javascript and make my own.


HOW TO PLAY: Use your arrow keys to move the tiles. When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into one!

Created by Brian Chuk. Inspired by Get MIT by Mitchell Gu. Based on 2048 by Gabriele Cirulli. and 1024 by Veewo Studio and conceptually similar to Threes by Asher Vollmer.

Except for Stuyvesant (of course hahaha), the high schools aren't really ranked in any legit order. This entire thing is a joke so you really should not take this seriously; I really don't like to bash on any high school so sorry if you're in the lower places >___>
Here is the ordering I placed if you are curious (Highest --> Lowest):
		   Name:        

1          Stuyvesant             

2          Hunter                 

3          Staten Island Tech     

4          Bronx Science          

5          Townshend              

6          La Guardia <3          

7          Brooklyn Tech          

8          Brooklyn Latin        

9          Cardozo                

10         Lehman High School     

11         Queens High School   







Schools do not represent their students. It is the students that represent their schools.
